            <h1>Welcome to Sorobanathon: Equinox<br/>February 3rd - April 1st, 2023.</h1>
            <p>Sorobanathon is back for the new year! Once again, you can earn rewards by experimenting with Soroban and creating content to share your experience. We are looking for any kind of content, big or small!</p>
            <p><strong>Our goals</strong> with Sorobanathon: Equinox are to continue gathering feedback that will guide the development of Soroban, and more importantly, to generate content that will help kickstart the Soroban ecosystem. So roll up your sleeves, experiment, and have some fun!</p>
            <p>During First Light, we received a ton of requests to increase the reward band to allow for more extensive projects‚Ä¶ and we are happy to announce that in Sorobanathon: Equinox, you can earn up to from 25 all the way to up to 10,000 XLM for a single submission! This is a fun, low-lift way to tinker with Soroban while you help shape its development and grow the ecosystem as a whole.</p>
          </div>

          <div className='hp--content'>
            <h2>Here are the kind of submissions we're looking for:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Code examples (<a href="https://sorobandev.com/">sorobandev.com</a>)</li>
              <li>Practical tutorials (such as this Game betting contract)</li>
              <li>Fun dapp tutorials (such as this adoption tracking system for a pet shop)</li>
              <li>Video walkthroughs (such as this one on Stellar Quest)</li>
              <li>Soroban for X developer tutorials (X = another smart contracts platform, such as Ethereum, Near, or Solana)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Also, if you're trying to do something and it doesn't work, let us know!  File a good issue and/or document your experience in some way, and turn that in!  Soroban is still a work in progress, and info about issues, bugs, and blockers is super useful right now.</p>
            <p>You can file new issues (and see existing issues) in the  Soroban CLI repo or the Soroban SDK repo.  If you do file an issue, make sure to link to it in your Sorobanathon: Equinox submission.  If you have questions, feel free to ask them in the Stellar Dev Discord #soroban-help channel</p>
